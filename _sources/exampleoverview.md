# Example Overview

![Stimuli](MathStim.png)

## Task

Participants were instructed to:

* Multiply first 3 numbers (in white) in head
* Look at the answer (in blue) until it turned green
* Decide if the answer is correct/incorrect when the number turns green
* Indicate how certain they were

## Study
* 156 items per half in three conditions
  * Correct Product
  * Incorrect Product: not related to the problem in any way
  * Related Product: created by adding 1 two or 3 to one of the operands.
* All math problems used operands 1-9, and did not require knowledge of times tables past 9x9
* In between the two halves, a questionnaire was given to try to induce a stereotype threat through making the participants think about how much anxiety math gives them.
* Neuropsych tests were given after the EEG data were collected

## Event codes

5 digit event code for the product stimuli

* Digit 1:
  * 0 - operand
  * 1 - product
  * 2 - question
* Digit 2:
  * 1-3 - No stereotype threat
  * 4-6 - Stereotype threat
  * 1,4 - Correct Product
  * 2,5 - Related Product
  * 3,6 - Incorrect Product
* Digits 3-5:
  * Item number
